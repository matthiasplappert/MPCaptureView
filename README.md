# MPCaptureView

MPCaptureView is a drop-in class that makes previewing the input from an AVCaptureDevice super easy. MPCaptureView is licensed under the MIT license and works with iOS 5 or later.


## Installation

Simply clone the git directory and add `MPCaptureView.h`, `MPCaptureView.m`, `AVCaptureDevice+MPAdditions.h` and `AVCaptureDevice+MPAdditions.m` to your project.

MPCaptureView uses ARC, so you need to enable that.


## Usage

MPCaptureView comes with an example that illustrates how to use it. Make sure to link against the AVFoundation.framework.
